- Points and coins are interchangeable terms in the system
- Teachers can only access students in their assigned groups
- All responses follow the standard APIResponse format with `success` and `data` fields
- Pagination is not implemented for teacher endpoints as groups typically have manageable student counts
- Students are automatically sorted by points when retrieving group members
